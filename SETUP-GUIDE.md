## 🔒 Security & Privacy Notes

- **All processing is local**: Your bank statements never leave your device
- **No server uploads**: Files are processed in your browser using JavaScript
- **HTTPS encryption**: GitHub Pages uses secure HTTPS
- **Private repos**: If you want extra privacy, upgrade to GitHub Pro ($4/month) for private repositories

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Custom Domain (Optional)
Want to use `tools.o2store.lk` instead of GitHub's URL?

1. Buy a domain (if you don't have one)
2. In GitHub Pages settings, add your custom domain
3. Update your domain's DNS settings
4. GitHub provides detailed instructions when you add the domain

### Going Private
If you later want to make your repository private:

1. Go to Settings → General
2. Scroll to the bottom
3. Click "Change visibility" → "Make private"
4. You'll need GitHub Pro for Pages to work with private repos

### Version Control
GitHub automatically keeps a history of all changes:
- You can always go back to previous versions
- You can see what changed and when
- Perfect for tracking improvements

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "404 - Page not found"
**Solution**:
- Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
- Check that files are in the root of the repository (not in a subfolder)
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings

### Problem: "File not found" when clicking tools
**Solution**:
- Make sure the `tools` folder is uploaded correctly
- Check that `bank-to-xero.html` is inside the `tools` folder
- File names are case-sensitive

### Problem: Converter doesn't work
**Solution**:
- Make sure you're uploading a CSV file
- Check that your browser allows downloads
- Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

### Problem: Can't upload files to GitHub
**Solution**:
- Try a different browser
- Check your file size (should be under 25MB total)
- Upload files one at a time if batch upload fails
